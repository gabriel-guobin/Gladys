#### Please describe your current position and research interests.
► 请描述您当前的职位和研究领域。

Elizabeth Ligon Bjork: I am Professor of Psychology and Immediate-Past Chair of the University of California, Los Angeles, Academic Senate. My research interests have included visual attention and developmental processes but now focus on practical and theoretical issues in human memory and learning, particularly the role that inhibitory processes play in an efficient memory system. 

伊丽莎白·里根·比约克（Elizabeth Ligon Bjork）：我是洛杉机加州大学的心理学教授。我的研究方向是视觉注意力及其发展过程，但现在专注于人类记忆和学习的实际与理论的关系，特别是在有效记忆中的作用。

Robert A. Bjork: I am Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research focuses on human learning and memory and on the implications of the science of learning for instruction and training. 

罗伯特·比约克（Robert A. Bjork）：我是洛杉矶加州大学特聘心理学教授。 我的研究重点是人类的学习和记忆，以及对练习的影响。

#### How did you get interested in studying the facilitating effect of apparent impediments to learning? 
► 是什么引起了你对学习阻碍的研究? 

Elizabeth Bjork: My interests in optimizing learning were triggered by interactions with students lamenting during office hours how hard they had studied, only then to perform poorly on a just-given exam. This motivated me to examine why students’ study activities were sometimes so ineffective. 

伊丽莎白·比约克（Elizabeth Bjork）：我对提高学习效率的研究，源自于学生们总是感叹他们学习努力刻苦，却在考试中表现糟糕。这促使了我思考为什么学生们的学习常常效率低下。

Robert Bjork: My interests go back to my efforts—as a graduate student— to understand the relationship of forgetting and learning, especially why inducing forgetting often enhances subsequent learning. My interests in the application of “desirable difficulties” were fanned by my experiences teaching and coaching and from what I learned as Chair of the National Research Council Committee on Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Performance (1988–1994). 

罗伯特·比约克（Robert Bjork）：当我还是研究生的时候，就开始研究遗忘与学习的关系，尤其如何利用遗忘的频率提高学习效率。我研究「必要难度」运用的动机，是在担任国家技术研究委员会主席时的经历（1988-1994年）。

#### What has been the real-world impact of this work?
► 这项研究对社会有什么影响？

Overall, the impact has been slight. There are multiple indications, however, that the impact of basic research findings on educational practices is increasing and that, in particular, optimizing instruction will require unintuitive innovations in how the conditions of instruction are structured. 

整体来说，影响一直很小。但无论如何，基础研究结果对教育实践的影响与日俱增，特别是优化教学将需要在教学条件如何结构化方面进行直观的创新。

As teachers—and learners—the two of us have had both a professional and personal interest in identifying the activities that make learning most effective and efficient. What we have discovered, broadly, across our careers in research, is that optimizing learning and instruction often requires going against one’s intuitions, deviating from standard instructional practices, and managing one’s own learning activities in new ways. Somewhat surprisingly, the trials and errors of everyday living and learning do not seem to result in the development of an accurate mental model of the self as learner or an appreciation of the activities that do and do not foster learning.

作为老师和学者，我们从专业和自身角度去判断学习最有效的方法。经过我们大量研究发现，提升学习效率的方法常常违背自己的认知，偏离我们学习习惯，并以一种新的方式进行学习。有些令人惊讶的是，日常生活和学习的经验教训并不能提升学习者个体精确的心智模式水平，也不能提升对是否能够促进学习的方式方法的鉴别能力。

The basic problem learners confront is that we can easily be misled as to whether we are learning effectively and have or have not achieved a level of learning and comprehension that will support our subsequent access to information or skills we are trying to learn. We can be misled by our subjective impressions. Rereading a chapter a second time, for example, can provide a sense of familiarity or perceptual fluency that we interpret as understanding or comprehension, but may actually be a product of low-level perceptual priming. Similarly, information coming readily to mind can be interpreted as evidence of learning, but could instead be a product of cues that are present in the study situation, but that are unlikely to be present at a later time. We can also be misled by our current performance. Conditions of learning that make performance improve rapidly often fail to support long-term retention and transfer, whereas conditions that create challenges and slow the rate of apparent learning often optimize long-term retention and transfer. 

学习者面临基本问题是我们很容易被误导，我们学习是否有效或者是否已经完全理解，足以明白随后学习的信息以及知识技能。我们容易被主观印象误导。例如，我们重读一章节，容易形成一种我们已经“学会”了的认知，但是实际可能是低级知觉启动的产物。同样，信息快速的提取被认为是“学会的”的证据，而实际上只是学习过程中的记忆线索而已，一段时间之后可能就会衰减甚至消失。我们同样也容易被表面现象迷惑。快速提升学习效率的方法，常常不能长时记忆和转化，而创造必要难度和降低学习速度能加强长时记忆和转化。

### Learning versus Performance 
### 学习与表现

This apparent paradox is a new twist on an old and time-honored distinction in psychology—namely, the distinction between learning and performance. Performance is what we can observe and measure during instruction or training. Learning—that is, the more or less permanent change in knowledge or understanding that is the target of instruction—is something we must try to infer, and current performance can be a highly unreliable index of whether learning has occurred. 

这个矛盾点也是新旧心理学的区别，即学习与表现的关系。表现，在平时学习生活中可以观察与测试的。学习，也就是说，在教学中培训中，了解其知识掌握的变化，这是我们必须推测的，而以现在的表现去了解学习状况则是非常不靠谱的指标。

### Learning Without Performance and Performance Without Learning 
### 没有表现的学习和没有学习的表现

Decades ago, learning theorists were forced to distinguish between learning and performance because experiments revealed that considerable learning could happen across a period when no change was apparent in performance. In latent-learning experiments with animals, for example, periods of free exploration of a maze, during which the animal’s behavior seemed aimless, were shown—once reward was introduced—to have produced considerable learning. Similarly, in research on motor skills, investigators found that learning continued across trials during which the build-up of fatigue suppressed performance. 

几十年前，学习理论家被迫区分学习和表现，因为实验表明，在一段时间内可以学习到很多知识，而在表现中没有明显任何变化。在动物的潜在学习实验中，例如，在自由探索迷宫的时期，在此期间，动物的行为看起来毫无目的，但一旦引入奖励，动物则可被训练。同样的，在研究运动技能方面，调查人员发现，持续不断的学习，疲劳的积聚抑制了表现。

More recently, a variety of experiments—some of which we summarize below—have demonstrated that the converse is true as well: Namely, substantial improvements in performance across practice or training sessions can occur without significant learning (as revealed after a delay or in another context). To the extent, therefore, that people interpret current performance as a valid measure of learning, they become susceptible to misassessing whether learning has or has not occurred. 

最近，大量实验表明（部分实验将在下文概述）也证明这一点确实如此：即，在实践或培训课程中，表现的实质性改善并没有明显引起学习质的变化（稍后作概述）。因此，在某种程度上，人们将目前的表现认作为有效的学习措施，他们容易会被误认为学习是否已经发生。


### Storage Strength Versus Retrieval Strength 
### 存储强度与检索强度

At a theoretical level, we (Bjork & Bjork, 1992) distinguish between the storage strength and the retrieval strength of information or skills stored in memory. Storage strength reflects how entrenched or interassociated a memory representation is with related knowledge and skills, whereas retrieval strength reflects the current activation or accessibility of that representation and is heavily influenced by factors such as situational cues and recency of study or exposure. Importantly, we assume that current performance is entirely a function of current retrieval strength, but that storage strength acts to retard the loss (forgetting) and enhance the gain (relearning) of retrieval strength. The key idea for present purposes is that conditions that most rapidly increase retrieval strength differ from the conditions that maximize the gain of storage strength. In other words, if learners interpret current retrieval strength as storage strength, they become susceptible to preferring poorer conditions of learning to better conditions of learning. 

在理论层面上，我们（Bjork＆Bjork，1992）分为存储强度和记忆信息检索强度。存储强度是指记忆表征中相关知识和技能的储存量，而检索强度指记忆表征的当前激活或可及性，并容易受到如情景暗示和新近学习的影响。重要的是，我们假设当前的表现与当前的检索强度呈正比例关系，而存储强度实则可以阻止丢失（遗忘）并提高检索强度。当前目的的关键在于，快速提高检索强度的的条件与最大化增强存储强度的条件不同。换句话说，如果学习者将当前检索强度理解为存储强度，他们将会进行低效学习。

### Introducing Desirable Difficulties to Enhance Learning and Instruction 
### 采用必要难度提高学习效率

So what are these better conditions of learning that, while apparently creating difficulty, actually lead to more durable and flexible learning? Such desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events. 

那么，什么情况下学习效果会更好呢？看似提高了难度，实际却带来更持久、灵活的学习效果。这种 必要难度（desirable difficulties） (Bjork, 1994)包括：改变学习条件，而不是保持学习的固定和可预测；不同主题交叉教学，而不是集中教学一个主题(called blocking)；对固定主题学习，需间隔学习而非集中学习；用测试作为学习活动，而非讲授。

Before proceeding further, we need to emphasize the importance of the word desirable. Many difficulties are undesirable during instruction and forever after. Desirable difficulties, versus the array of undesirable difficulties, are desirable because they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties. 

在进一步讨论前，我们需要强调 「必要(desirable)」 这个词的重要性。在此之后的教学中，许多困难都是不必要。必要难度与那些不必要困难相比，必要难度是必须的，因为它需要在你学习之上的理解、记忆中去检索信息。然而，如果学习者没有相关知识背景或技能来支撑，那么就没有在必要难度范围内。


### Varying the Conditions of Practice 
### 变换练习的条件

When instruction occurs under conditions that are constrained and predictable, learning tends to become contextualized. Material is easily retrieved in that context, but the learning does not support later performance if tested at a delay, in a different context, or both. In contrast, varying conditions of practice—even varying the environmental setting in which study sessions take place—can enhance recall on a later test. For example, studying the same material in two different rooms rather than twice in the same room leads to increased recall of that material (Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978)—an empirical result that flies in the face of the common how- to-study suggestion to find a quiet, convenient place and do all your studying there. 

当教学条件受到局限及可预测时，学习会倾向情境化。在这种情况下，立即检索信息很容易，但是如果推迟测试，或者改变情境，或两者皆有，那么学习效果则会大大折扣。相比之下，改变练习的条件，甚至改变学习环境，则可在稍后测试中提高信息检索能力。例如，在不同的两间房间中各学习一次同一份资料，比在同一个地方学习现两次，更容易提取材料信息（ Smith，Glenberg，＆Bjork，1978 ）。从这份研究结果看，传统学习建议总是呆一个地方似乎并不好。

A study of children’s learning provides a striking illustration of the benefits of varying conditions of practice. Eight-year-olds and 12-year-olds practiced throwing beanbags at a target on the floor with their vision occluded at the time of each throw. For each age group, half of the children did all their practicing throwing to a target at a fixed distance (for example, 3 feet for the 8-year-olds), while the other half threw to targets that were closer or farther away. After the learning sessions and a delay, all children were tested at the distance used in the fixed-practice condition for their age group (Kerr & Booth, 1978). 

一项关于儿童学习的研究对改变练习条件带来的优势提供了明显例证。让8岁和12岁的孩子们练习朝地面上的目标扔沙包，每次投掷时都会蒙上眼睛。对于每个年龄组，一半的孩子们练习投掷固定距离（例如，8岁-3英尺）的目标，而另一半则练习投掷到距离可变的目标（更近或更远）。在练习完成并推迟一段时间后，让所有的孩子在其年龄组的固定条件下，同样距离进行测试（Kerr＆Booth，1978）。

Common sense would suggest that the children who practiced at the tested distance would perform better than those who had never practiced at that distance, but the opposite was true for both age groups. The benefits of variation—perhaps learning something about adjusting the parameters of the motor program that corresponded to the throwing motion—outweighed any benefits of being tested at the practiced distance. Many other studies have shown that when testing after training takes place under novel conditions, the benefits of variation during learning are even larger. 

直觉认为，在测试距离上练习过的孩子比那些没有练习过的表现要好一些，但是两个年龄组的测试结果都正好相反。改变条件的好处是：可能学习调整投掷运动程序的参数，比起在相同距离上的大量练习更有优势。大量其他研究表明，相比在训练结束后变换测试的条件，变换学习过程中条件更有益处。


### Spacing Study or Practice Sessions 
### 间隔学习还是集中单元练习

The effects of distributed practice on learning are complex. Although massing practice (for example, cramming for exams) supports short-term performance, spacing practice (for example, distributing presentations, study attempts, or training trials) supports long-term retention. The benefits of spacing on long-term retention, called the spacing effect, have been demonstrated for all manner of materials and tasks, types of learners (human and animal), and time scales; it is one of the most general and robust effects from across the entire history of experimental research on learning and memory. 

分散式练习对学习的影响是多元的。尽管集中大量练习（ 例如，死记硬背 ）能获得短时记忆，但间隔练习（ 例如分散式教学，图式学习或自我测试 ）则保持长时记忆。间隔练习对长时记忆的益处，称为间隔效应。通过对各种任务和材料、学习者（ 人类和动物 ）的类型和时间尺度的研究，已经证明间隔效应是整个学习与记忆实验研究史上最具普遍、强大的效果之一。

Rather than describing any of the myriad studies that have demonstrated the benefits of spacing, we will simply stress the importance of incorporating spacing and avoiding massing in managing learning. Massing repeated-study activities is often not only convenient, but it can also seem logical from the standpoint of organizing one’s learning of different topics, and it frequently results in rapid gains in apparent learning. Good test performance following an all-night cramming session is certainly rewarding, but little of what was recallable on the test will remain recallable over time. In contrast, a study schedule that spaces study sessions on a particular topic can produce both good exam performance and good long-term retention. Furthermore, because new learning depends on prior learning, spacing study sessions optimally can also enhance transfer of knowledge and provide a foundation for subsequent new learning. 

无数研究表明间隔练习的好处，我们将着重介绍间隔练习和避免集中大量学习的重要性。大量重复的学习活动不仅易于操作，而且从不同的角度来看似乎也合常理，其也常常看到明显的学习快速增长。全天候的填鸭式学习肯定会获得一个好的测试成绩，但是随着时间推移，测试中的内容则只剩下少部分内容被记起。相对的，按照学习计划对特定主题进行间隔学习，则不仅可以获得优异成绩，也能保持长时记忆。此外，新知识依赖于先前学习的知识，间隔学习也能最大化的提高知识的转化，为后续学习新知识奠定基础。

### Interleaving versus Blocking Instruction on Separate To-Be-Learned Tasks 
### 交错式学习与批量式学习

Interleaving the practice of separate topics or tasks is an excellent way to introduce spacing and other learning dynamics. In a classic comparison of interleaving and blocking (Shea & Morgan, 1979), participants practiced three different movement patterns, each requiring the participants to knock down three of six hinged barriers rapidly on a pinball-like apparatus in a prescribed order. All participants received 18 trials on each pattern, but in the interleaved condition, practice on a given trial was randomly determined, whereas in the blocked condition, one pattern at a time was practiced. 

交错式主题学习是极好学习的方法，它采用间隔学习和交替学习。在一项经典交错与批量对照实验中（Shea＆Morgan，1979），测试者分为三组，以三种不同的方式练习，要求测试者都以规定的顺序快速击中六个障碍物中的三个。三组测试者都练习18次，但是分为交错式练习、随机练习及批量式练习。 

As you probably suspect, participants given blocked practice improved more rapidly than those given interleaved/random practice. Thus, if the researchers had stopped their study at the end of training, blocking of practice would have seemed the superior learning procedure. But, instead, participants returned 10 days later and were retested under either blocked or interleaved/random conditions. Under interleaved/random testing conditions, participants who had practiced under interleaved conditions performed far better than did the blocked-practice participants, who appeared, when tested under a random schedule, to have learned virtually nothing. Under blocked testing conditions, performance was essentially the same for both groups, but the small difference still favored the interleaved group. 

你有可能认为，批量式练习者会比交错式练者/随机练习者更快学会。假使研究人员让他们马上停止练习，批量式练习者似乎更胜一筹。但是，相反地，练习者在10天以后返回，并且在批量式、交错式及随机顺序条件下进行再次测试。在交错/随机测试条件下，交错式练习者远比批量式练者表现更好，批量式练习者在随机测试条件下，表现糟糕。在批量测试条件下，三组练习方式者的表现基本相当，但交错式练习者略占上风。

The skills literature includes many replications of the pattern that blocked practice appears optimal for learning, but interleaved practice actually results in superior long-term retention and transfer of skills, and research illustrates that learners—as well as instructors—are at risk of being fooled by that pattern. For example, when participants who had learned three different keystroke patterns were asked to predict their performance on a test the next day, those given interleaved practice predicted their performance quite closely, whereas those given blocked practice were markedly overconfident (Simon & Bjork, 2001). In effect, the blocked-practice group misinterpreted their good performance during practice as evidence of long-term learning, rather than a product of the local (that is, blocked) conditions. Said differently, they misinterpreted the retrieval strength of a given keystroke pattern as an index of its storage strength. 

技能文献中包含大量这种类型的实验研究，其表明批量式练习能快速提高学习，但交错式练习却更能保持长久记忆和技能强化，对于这研究结果，作为学习者及教师可能会被批量式学习误导的风险。例如，当这三组练习者被问及预测第二天测试表现时，那些交错式练习者的表现与他们预测基本一致，而那些批量式练习者的预测则过于自信(Simon&Bjork，2001)。实际上，批量式练习者误将短暂性的良好表现当作是长期表现效果。换句话，他们把既定的检索强度当作为其存储强度的指标。

Other results illustrate that the benefits of interleaved practice extend beyond the learning of motor skills. For example, when participants were asked to learn formulas for calculating the volumes of different solids, such as a truncated cone, in either a blocked or interleaved manner, interleaved instruction enhanced performance on a delayed test. The size of the long-term advantage of interleaved practice was striking: 63 percent versus 20 percent of new problems worked correctly a week later (Rohrer & Taylor, 2007). 

其他研究表明，交错式练习不仅适用于动作技能的学习，也适用于其他学习。例如，当这些测试者学习用公式计算不同形状的立方体的体积，如圆椎体，分别以批量和交错式方式进行练习，在一段时间之后测试，交错学习者提高了测验成绩。交错式练习效果是惊人的，有63%被长久记忆，仅20%被遗忘(Rohrer&Taylor，2007)。

More recently and surprisingly, we have found that interleaving even enhances inductive learning (Kornell & Bjork, 2008). When participants were asked to learn the styles of each of 12 artists based on a sample of 6 paintings by each artist, interleaving a given artist’s paintings among the paintings by other artists—versus presenting that artist’s paintings one after another (blocking)—enhanced participants’ later ability to identify the artist responsible for each of a series of new paintings. This result is surprising because blocking would seem to make it easier to note the commonalities that characterize a particular artist’s style. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 1, the majority of participants—when asked after the test whether interleaving or blocking had helped them learn an artist’s style better—definitely had the impression that blocking had been more effective than interleaving, the opposite of their actual learning. Blocking may indeed have facilitated noticing commonalities, but the final test required distinguishing among the artists, and interleaving may have fostered learning the differences as well as similarities among the styles of different artists. 

最令人惊讶的是，我们发现交错式学习增强了归纳能力(Kornell&Bjork，2008)。在这份研究中，测试者观看12位画家的作品，每个艺术家各有6幅作品，其中一组采用交错式学习，将某一画家的作品跟其他画家作品交错在一起进行观看，而另一组则是批量式学习，学习完一位画家作品再学另一位画家作品，观看结束后，测试者要判断新画分别是属于以上哪位画家的作品。这个结果出乎意料，因为批量式学习者应该更容易注意到每幅画的共同点，进而总结出每位画家的风格。实际上，如图1所示，在测试后，在问及大多数测试者，交错式和批量式，哪种学习方法更好帮助他们了解每位画家的风格，令人印象深刻的是，认为批量式学习比交错式学习更有效，却与其实际学习相反。批量式学习可能确实有助于注意共同点，但最终测试是要求区分众多画家的作品，而交错式学习可能更易促进测试者区分、归纳每位画家的差异及相似之处。

Why might interleaving enhance long-term retention and transfer? One theory suggests that having to resolve the interference among the different things under study forces learners to notice similarities and differences among them, resulting in the encoding of higher-order representations, which then foster both retention and transfer. Another explanation suggests that interleaving forces learners to reload memories: If required to do A, then B, then C, and then A again, for example, the memory for how to do A must be reloaded a second time, whereas doing A and then A again does not involve the same kind of reloading. Such repeated reloadings are presumed to foster learning and transfer to the reloading that will be required when that knowledge or skill is needed at a later time. 

为什么交错式学习可以提高长时记忆和强化？其中一个理论认为，这可能是因为交错式学习使得学习者必须不断克服不同学习内容间的干扰，迫使学习者注意到其间的异同，从而促进在学习过程中的高水平表征，进而长久保持和强化。另一个理论解释认为，交错式学习使得学习者不断地从记忆中加载信息。例如，在A-B-C-A……的交错式学习过程中，第二次学习A时需要对A进行二次加载，而如果是A-A-A……批量式学习则不会进行二次加载。如此推测反复加载是为了促进学习和转化，而这也是要求在一段时间后需要对之前的知识或技能进行二次加载。

From the standpoint of our theoretical framework (Bjork & Bjork, 1992), learning from reloading is an instance of a broader dynamic in human memory: Namely, that forgetting (losing retrieval strength) creates the opportunity for increasing the storage strength of to-be-learned information or skills. Said differently, when some skill or knowledge is maximally accessible from memory, little or no learning results from additional instruction or practice. 

从我们“必要难度”理论观点来看(Bjork&Bjork，1992)，对学习或记忆内容的再次加载在人类记忆中具有更广泛的意义：即，遗忘（检索弱化）为提高将要学习的知识或技能的存储强度的创造了机会。换言而之，当这些技能或知识能从记忆中最大限度的提取，那么在学习中则不会获得额外的启发。

### Generation Effects and Using Tests (Rather Than Presentations) as Learning Events 
### 生成效应和测试效应

An effect that rivals the spacing effect for its generality and its significance for instruction and learning is the generation effect, which refers to the long-term benefit of generating an answer, solution, or procedure versus being presented that answer, solution, or procedure. Basically, any time that you, as a learner, look up an answer or have somebody tell or show you something that you could, drawing on current cues and your past knowledge, generate instead, you rob yourself of a powerful learning opportunity. Retrieval, in effect, is a powerful “memory modifier” (Bjork, 1975). 

在教育实践中，与间隔效应具有同等重要与意义的另一效应是生成效应，它是指自我生成的答案、解决方案或过程比直接呈现答案、解决方案或过程要更容易记住。也就是说，任何时候，作为一名学习者，您可以自行查找答案，或某人告诉你或呈现一些线索给你，利用当前的提示和已有的知识得到答案更利于你长久记忆，否则你将失去一个强大的学习机会。检索过程，实际上是一个相当有力的“记忆修改器”（Bjork，1975）。


Closely related to the generation effect are the benefits that accompany retrieving information studied earlier. Much laboratory research (for example, Landauer & Bjork, 1978; Carrier & Pashler, 1992) has demonstrated the power of tests as learning events, and, in fact, a test or retrieval attempt, even when no corrective feedback is given, can be considerably more effective in the long term than reading material over and over. The reason why rereading is such a typical mode of studying derives, we believe, from a faulty model of how we learn and remember: We tend to think of our memories as working much like an audio/video recorder, so if we read and reread or take verbatim notes, the information will eventually write itself on our memories. Nothing, however, could be further from the way we actually learn and remember. 

生成效应与早期的信息检索研究紧密相关。大量研究证明（如：Landauer＆Bjork，1978; Carrier＆Pashler，1992），测试是学习过程中强有力的助力，即使没有给予反馈，测试或检索信息也比简单重复阅读更有效更利于长久记忆。“反复阅读”却是学习中经常采用的一种方法，这是源自于我们错误的学习认知：我们认为我们的记忆就像摄像机或录像机一样，只要反复诵读或逐段背诵，信息最终会“写入”我们的记忆之中。然而，实际上我们可能最终会一无所获。

Unfortunately, the effectiveness of tests as learning events remains largely underappreciated, in part because testing is typically viewed as a vehicle of assessment, not a vehicle of learning. As Henry L. Roediger, Kathleen B. McDermott, and Mark A. McDaniel describe in their essay in this chapter, however, recent research using more educationally realistic materials and retention intervals has clearly demonstrated the pedagogical benefits of tests (for example, Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Similar to the pattern with variation, spacing, and interleaving, repeated study opportunities appear, in the short term, to be more effective than repeated testing, but testing produces better recall in the long term. 

遗憾的是，测试效应在学习中的效用并未被引起足够的重视，究其原因是因为测试常被当作是评判工具，而不是学习载体。正如Roediger等人研究发现，在大量实际教学案例中，必要难度证明了在教学中测试的效果(如, Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)。与变换场景、间隔式和交错式类似，在短期内，重复学习比自我检测更有学习效率，但从大时间周期来看，自我测试的内容更易被保存、记忆。


Two other pedagogical benefits of tests must be mentioned: First, tests have metacognitive benefits in terms of identifying whether information has or has not been understood and/or learned. A student’s ability, for example, when going back over a chapter in a textbook, to judge whether information will be recallable on an upcoming examination is severely limited, whereas attempting to answer a fellow student’s questions on the chapter can identify what has and has not been learned. 

此外，必须提及测试在教学中另外两个好处：首先，测试有益于元认知，诊断所学内容是否已理解或掌握。例如，当进行上一章内容的测试时，能被学生记忆起的内容是有限的，这也就有助于学生判断哪些是已掌握，哪些是未掌握的。

The second, related benefit is that tests can potentiate the effectiveness of subsequent study opportunities even under conditions that insure learners will be incorrect on the test (Kornell, Hays, & Bjork, 2009). Again, the basic message is that we need to spend less time restudying and more time testing ourselves. 

其次，即使测试成绩很糟糕，也能提高随后的学习效率（Kornell，Hays和Bjork，
2009）。最后，再次强调，我们应该少花时间重复学习，而是更多的自我测试。

### Concluding Comments 
### 总结

For those of you who are students, we hope we have convinced you to take a more active role in your learning by introducing desirable difficulties into your own study activities. Above all, try to rid yourself of the idea that memory works like a tape or video recorder and that re-exposing yourself to the same material over and over again will somehow write it onto your memory. Rather, assume that learning requires an active process of interpretation— that is, mapping new things we are trying to learn onto what we already know. (There’s a lesson here for those of you who are teachers—or parents— as well: Consider how you might introduce desirable difficulties into the teaching of your students or children.) 

致那些学习者，我们希望在你的学习中使用必要难度，相信它能提高你的学习效率。最重要的是，你要摒弃传统观念，即：记忆像磁带或录像机一样，反复阅读就可以某种方式“写入”记忆中。相反，要求学习者有一个活跃的头脑，也就是说，我们要将正在学习的新知识映射到我们已掌握、了解的知识中。（这同样也适用于家长或老师：在你的学生或孩子教学中，也请采用必要难度教学。）

Be aware, too, when rereading a chapter or your notes, that prior exposures create a sense of familiarity that can easily be confused with understanding. And perhaps most importantly, keep in mind that retrieval—much more than restudying—acts to modify your memory by making the information you practice retrieving more likely to be recallable again in the future and in different contexts. In short, try to spend less time on the input side and more time on the output side, such as summarizing what you have read from memory or getting together with friends and asking each other questions. Any activities that involve testing yourself—that is, activities that require you to retrieve or generate information, rather than just representing information to yourself—will make your learning both more durable and flexible. 

再次注意，当你重复阅读某一内容时，先前阅读的经验易将你困惑、不解之处误认为已理解、掌握。最重要的是检索练习，不仅是重新复习，更是加强记忆、巩固知识，在将来或不同场景中也更容易提取知识。换言之，学习者应该在“输入端”花费相对较少的时间，而应该花更多时间在“输出端”，比如：概括所学知识，与朋友互相提问。要经常自我测试，即经常回顾加强记忆，而不仅是单纯学习，这使你的知识更加长久记忆。

Finally, we cannot overstate the importance of learning how to manage your own learning activities. In a world that is ever more complex and rapidly changing, and in which learning on one’s own is becoming ever more important, learning how to learn is the ultimate survival tool. 

最后，我们不能夸大如何管理自我学习活动的重要性。在一个越来越复杂和快速变化的世界中，终身学习变得越来越重要，学习是最终的生存工具。
